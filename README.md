# The-Steel-Data-Finance-Analysis
This challenge involves analyzing customer banking behavior for 'The Big Bank'. The objective is to gain insight into customer account behavior, such as identifying the names of customers who live in a specific location, the total number of accounts, the total balance of checking accounts, the total balance of accounts associated with specific locations and customers, and the branch with the highest average account balance, among others.
